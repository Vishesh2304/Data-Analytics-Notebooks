# Data-Analytics-Notebooks
Using various data science and data visualisation libraries to try and tell get data to tell a story.

These notebooks won't be State of the Art implementations of Machine Learning. The objective is to illustrate how we can use simple Data Manipulation, Data Visualization and Machine Learning libraries in Python to get actionable insights from data. 

This is the foundation of Data Science, accounts for a large portion of commercial applications and is fundamental for understanding the Data Science workflow. 

Now that we have set our expectations, let's head to the [first notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-HdkDkIrMxCO-PLIcE17FKrk-CMT2uT5#scrollTo=ZYwzmKOzGKCK) to explore how we can use basic Python libraries in an E-Commerce context to derive some actionable insights.
